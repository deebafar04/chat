# Model.earth CodeChat

A multimodal AI chat application built on the [Vercel AI Chatbot](https://github.com/vercel/ai-chatbot) starter, significantly extended for the [Model.earth](https://model.earth) open-source community.

- [Live app](https://modelearth.vercel.app/chat) · [Key manager](https://modelearth.vercel.app/chat/keys/) · [RAG ingestion](ingestion/)
- [Original Vercel template](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/chatbot) · [Vercel GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/ai-chatbot)

## What We Added

### API Key Management
A fully custom browser-based key manager (`/keys`) that stores API keys encrypted at rest using AES-GCM with a non-extractable browser key in IndexedDB — matching the same format used by the chat app. Features include:

- Add, remove, and validate keys per provider
- **Paste Keys** — paste multiple `KEY=value` lines from a `.env` file in one step
- **CopyMyKeys** — reveal decrypted keys in a time-limited window (5 / 20 / 60 min) for copying to another machine
- Server `.env` keys shown alongside browser keys with a `.env` badge
- Embeddable vanilla JS widget (no React, no build step) reusable across the webroot

### RAG — Retrieval-Augmented Generation
Semantic search over indexed GitHub repositories using Pinecone vector DB + Voyage AI embeddings:

- `ingestion/` pipeline indexes repo content as vector embeddings into Pinecone
- At chat time, the top matching code/doc snippets are retrieved and injected into the prompt
- RAG timing panel shows per-request latency (prompt received → RAG → LLM)
- Slow RAG (>8s) flagged in amber
- Configurable via `RAG_ENABLED`, `RAG_TOP_K`, `RAG_SCORE_THRESHOLD`, and other env vars

### GitHub Repo Selection Navigation
Users can select which GitHub repository to use as context for the current conversation. The selected repo filters RAG results and scopes GitHub MCP tool calls to the relevant codebase.

### Multi-Provider Support
Supports Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT, xAI Grok, Groq, Mistral, Perplexity, DeepSeek, Together AI, and Fireworks — all from a single interface. Keys are stored per-provider in browser storage and sent per-request to the server.

### Authentication — BetterAuth
Replaced the original Auth.js with [BetterAuth](https://better-auth.com) for email/password login and social providers (Google, GitHub, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Discord, Facebook). Sessions use JWE cookie caching.

### Settings Page
Simplified settings UI that shows a summary of saved keys and links to the `/keys` page. No duplicate key entry — all key management is on `/keys`.
